# IEEE-Report-Enabling 5G on the Ocean: A Hybrid Satellite-UAV-Terrestrial Network Solution
In this research paper we will look at the problem of
Maritime communication networks behind far behind the existing
5th Generation technology that exists mainly in the terrestrial
domain all across the world. We will also look at the Whyâ€™s
of this problem which deals with mostly the unpredictability of
deploying technology at sea and across oceans. To overcome the
problem we will discuss the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) integrated along with the existing technology which
consists of Satellites and Terrestrial Base stations (TBSs). We
will also see the practicality of the proposed solution as well as
the prerequisites considered and the specifications needed.
